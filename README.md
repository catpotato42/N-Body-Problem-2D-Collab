### N-Body-Simulation
## A two-dimensional graphical simulation of the n body problem in c++ using a initial value problem solver created from scratch as well as the win32 API library
# Created by Alex Burns and Simon Harrington
# Use instructions
Input a number of planets, desired fps (simulation speed), and simulation length.
Then, enter initial values (x-pos, y-pos, x-vel, y-vel, mass) for each planet and begin the simulation. 
Position variables are in pixels from the top left of the screen (positive down and right), which has its width and height (not dynamic so don't go resizing the window after the first screen) printed at the top left when entering initial values.
